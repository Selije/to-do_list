## to-do_list
Toy project written while learning Python. 

### Description
Program used for managing a list of tasks given by a user. 

Allows to add and change task name, description, `end_date` (date chosen by the user, by which the task should be done) and `status`(active, expired or done) of the task. 
Automatically sets `add_date`, when the user adds a new task, also automatically changes the task `status`, when `end_date` passed by.  
Serializes tasks to JSON and saves to file.  

Still needs some work and refactoring.
